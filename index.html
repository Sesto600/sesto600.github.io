									<p>My name is Matthew Sesto and I currently study I.T at RMIT University City Campus. I come from a heavily Croatian background with most my family having some Croatian in their blood. I can only speak partial Croatian but obviously fluent English. My hobbies include and are mostly sports related but to branch out to gaming as well. Soccer however is my main passion and I’ve been playing it ever since I could remember. I support Liverpool Football Club who play in the English Premier League. I currently play at St Albans Saints Soccer Club and have been doing so for the past 3 years. An interesting fact about myself would probably have to be that I was selected once to trial for Melbourne City’s academy side, unfortunately unsuccessful but still rather interesting and something not many people know about myself.</p>

									<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
									<p>My interest’s with-in the IT world don’t just stop at one field, they branch out into the never ending future possibilities that IT must offer. For all I know my main interest may not even be thought of yet. Currently though there are fields that I’m mainly interested in, the first being programming and the second being statistics. I enjoy programming because it allows me just to be creative and to create anything I really want to as well as the opportunity to challenge myself as there is so much to coding that I still need to learn. On the other hand, I enjoy statistics as I really enjoy keeping a track of them especially sports statistics as the amount of data generated is quite fascinating, that was probably where my interest for IT started because as a kid the only way I could see these statistics was through the internet and the use of IT which led to me enjoying it at school and now eventually to here.</p>
									<p>I choose to attend RMIT University for several reasons, firstly, I live rather close to Watergardens train station so it’s very easy for me to make my way to university, 1 train ride for 35 minutes and I’m there much easy than attending another technology university such as Swinburne where I would have to take multiple trains just to attend. Secondly, I know many people who are currently attending or have attended RMIT in the past and they all have had good things to say about the university which further persuaded me to a come to RMIT. Lastly, RMIT has a very good reputation in terms of their school of science and as IT falls under that category, I knew I was making the right decision in choosing it as my first preference and sure enough, I got in.</p>
									<p>I expect to learn multiple skills during my studies which will hopefully help me in finding and maintaining a job in the foreseeable future. Firstly, I would like to know how to code rather well considering I only know some basics plus a couple more things currently such as arrays and interface. I would also like to learn the ins and outs of databases and I think I could help me greatly in terms of having skills that employers might need. In general though apart from those two reasons I’d like to learn anything which gives me an advantages of somebody else in the future which would lead to me getting the job over that person.</p>
